Constable would have been familiar with this route since childhood, as he walked the 2 miles to school in Dedham every day!

We'll stop and contemplate the Summer Evening print and the view today.

We'll walk down to Flatford.

And then along the river bank to Dedham.

In Constable's time the towpath between these locations switched from bank to bank, as it crossed into territory of multiple adjacent landowners. Horses had to be trained to leap onto special platforms on the barges and stay steady while they were carried across the river.
