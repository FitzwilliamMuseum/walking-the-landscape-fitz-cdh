This project uses digital technologies to take prints locked in a museum back into the landscape 
which made them, which represents them, and of which they are part. Using an app enabling us to pinpoint 
and ‘see’ various Constable sketches we will curate a series of public walks in landscapes Constable sketched, 
documenting them to produce, as a form of public writing, a walking diary.

We are interested in what happens when we walk in one landscape but also see another, one produced by 
Constable, as a sketch, in another century. Amongst our questions are what kind of engagement with the 
work this produces. Walking with Constable enables a form of slow looking – very different from a typical 
gallery experience. It might highlight change and development of the landscape – and foreground issues of 
industrialisation present in Constable’s work. It might change the forms or modes of attention awarded to 
the sketches – from looking at to walking with, and also suggests re-thinking the relationship of the image 
to the land.

We are also interested in exploring how to document a shared experience of viewing and engagement. How does 
it feel to walk with Constable, what new perceptions, experiences or connections does it produce? How can we 
capture elements of that experience and bring together expert and general public experiences and produce a 
form of public writing? Finally how can we mix various kinds of expertise to inform are slow viewing?

We are also interested in both how much technology is needed to enable the walk (going low) and in how 
we might supplement the experience – in this case via accompanying ariel photography, via the use of embedded 
images to over-lay historical and ‘imaginary’ landscapes, and provide new perspectives on time, change, distance 
and experience.

Underpinning our inquiry are a series of questions:

1. How – and in what ways - to use digital technologies to engage with publics in ways that route around standard 
‘virtual’ gallery or museum formats. 
2. How to document these engagements in compelling and accessible ways.

We see this both as a standalone project that will produce interesting new forms of engagement with publics 
around the Constable and as a test site for future projects.
