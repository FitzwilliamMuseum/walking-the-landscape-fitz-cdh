In this second post based on conversations that happened during [Walk D]({{site.url}}/walks/Walk-D/), we touch on the origins of the [Ramblers’ Association](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/) and of the [Sudbury Ramblers](https://www.sudburyramblers.org.uk/) in particular. Today the Ramblers are a well-established, respectable facet of British culture, but in their early days being a Rambler could be nothing short of radical.

In the audio clip we first join the conversation with Ramblers John, Margaret and Florence as they discuss Kinder Scout, the mass trespass of 1932 which remains a pivotal moment in the Association’s folklore. Then, Keith talks of the Sudbury Ramblers’ early days half a century ago.  The campaigns waged then to keep local rights of way open ensured that future generations could walk freely on the same paths which Constable would have known and loved. 

Listen to the conversation in the below audio clip, or you can read the [transcription]({{site.url}}/audio/Walk-D-Rambling-Transciption.pdf).

You can also find out more information about the [Ramblers’ Association and their history](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/about-us/our-history.aspx) on their website.
