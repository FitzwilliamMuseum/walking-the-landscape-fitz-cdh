We brought a handheld twin microphone audio recorder with us on [Walk B]({{site.url}}/walks/Walk-B/). I’d never used one before and when I put the attached headphones on, I felt like I’d suddenly been gifted the hearing of a cat. 

I could hear the grass crunching and rustling at my feet as I shifted my weight from one foot to the other. I pointed the mic at two colleagues deep in conversation about twenty metres away, it sounded like I was standing right by them. 

For the rest of the walk I turned the mic on for every new sound, be it the creaking of a gate we were passing through or the call of a buzzard circling above us.

This five-minute audio track documents the walk, taking in an underpass with the A12 roaring above, the sound of the wind in willow and poplar trees, church bells, birdsong, water raging through a weir, the sedate progress of a paddle boarder and a mild disagreement in a rowing boat. 

It finishes, like all good walks, in the pub.
