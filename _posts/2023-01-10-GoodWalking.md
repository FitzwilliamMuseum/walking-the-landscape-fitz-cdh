On a cold but dry November day we were joined for [Walk D]({{site.url}}/walks/Walk-D/) by the Sudbury Ramblers, a group who regularly explore Constable Country, and by Simon Peachey who is the National Trust Site Manager for Flatford, a place intimately associated with the artist. It was a great day for conversations and over three blog posts we’ll drop in and out of what was said.

In this post I join Sudbury Ramblers members Margaret and Florence just after we’d walked up quite a steep hill. Margaret is from the area around Constable Country, as was her mother before her, whilst Florence moved to the region around thirty years ago. We talked about Margaret’s mother walking the country roads in the days before the motorcars changed everything, getting lost, and the good that walking does for you. 

You can listen to the conversation below or you can read the [transcription]({{site.url}}/audio/Walk-D-GoodWalking-Transciption.pdf).
