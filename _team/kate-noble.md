Kate is the strategic lead on research relating to learning and engagement practice at the Fitzwilliam 
Museum. She has a particular interest in collaborative action research and its potential to stimulate 
change and improve practice which we have been exploring through the Nursery in Residence, Lines of Enquiry 
and It's Our Museum Too projects. Kate leads the Inspire teacher training programme which encourages creative
teaching and learning using objects and images.

Kate holds a PhD in the Development of Visual Literacy in Young Children, and a BEd in Art and Early Years 
Education, both from the University of Cambridge. She is on the council of the National Society for 
Education in Art and Design (NSEAD), and is East Area rep and council member for engage, the advocacy 
organisation for gallery education. She is a member of the British Educational Research Association (BERA) 
and United Kingdom Literacy Association (UKLA). She has contributed chapters to books on multi-modal 
literacy in children and worked as a researcher for Tate's Young Cultural Creators Project. More recently 
she has led learning research and evaluation projects on behalf of the University of Cambridge Museums including 
the AHRC follow-on funded Practical Evaluation Project. Kate was runner-up in the Early Career Researcher Category 
of the 2021 Vice-Chancellor's Awards for Research Impact and Engagement at the University of Cambridge.
