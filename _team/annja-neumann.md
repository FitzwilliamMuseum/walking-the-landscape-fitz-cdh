Annja Neumann is an Affiliated Lecturer in Modern German Studies and Isaac Newton Trust Post-doctoral Research Fellow in Digital Humanities. Her practice-based research explores the staging of spaces and politics of embodiment, with a particular interest in the theatricalisation of medical spaces. Before taking up her post at Cambridge Digital Humanities (CDH), Dr Neumann was Research Associate of the AHRC Schnitzler Digital Edition Project at Cambridge.

 After studying German and Cultural Anthropology at the Universities of Heidelberg and Uppsala, she came to London for her PhD, which she completed at Queen Mary in 2012. Following on from her research on temporalities and historicities of post-1945 German poetry, she currently works on embodied space, digital dramaturgies, and medical scenography, drawing on her training as a cultural anthropologist.
