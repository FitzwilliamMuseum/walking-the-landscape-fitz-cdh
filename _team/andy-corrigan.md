Cambridge Digital Library is a home for the discovery of digitised material and research 
outputs from the University of Cambridge and beyond. Launched in 2011, it now hosts over 
half a million images of nearly 40,000 items from over thirty different institutions ranging from 
national collections to those of charitable trusts, societies and private collections. 

Amongst the many manuscripts and rare books, there are also a great number of photographic images.
