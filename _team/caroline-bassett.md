My research explores digital technologies in relation to questions of knowledge production and epistemology (how does 'the digital' change scholarship, transform understanding, produce new scales or perspectives?) and in relation to cultural forms, practices, and ways of being (how can we understand the stakes of informational capitalism, what are its symptoms, how can we understand its temporalities, the forms of life it enables, and those it forecloses?). I began with an English degree, and then became a technology journalist for some years, before returning to explore media theory at doctoral level. More recently I co-founded the Sussex Humanities Lab at Sussex University. Visiting fellowships include at McGill (IGSF), and as the Helsingin Sanomat Fellow at the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies. I arrived at Cambridge in Autumn 2019 as Professor of Digital Humanities and Director of Cambridge Digital Humanities (CDH).
