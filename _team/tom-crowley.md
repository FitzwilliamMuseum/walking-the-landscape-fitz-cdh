Hi, I’m Tom and I love museums. Over the past ten years I’ve worked in curatorial positions at the Horniman Museum and Gardens and at the University of Cambridge’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. I’ve also researched and published as an academic at the University's Heritage Research Centre, which is where I undertook my PhD. Recently I’ve taken on consultancy roles at the Powell-Cotton Museum and English Heritage. As my practice has developed I’ve combined my practical experience and research interests to specialise in interactive displays, co-curation methodologies, and audience development. I am currently building my expertise in digital curation.
