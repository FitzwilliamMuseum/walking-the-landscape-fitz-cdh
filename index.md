Few painters have so vividly evoked a sense of place in their work, one born of intimate familiarity
with the countryside he represented and his attentive observation of the smallest detail of the natural world.
Constable was born and brought up on the Suffolk-Essex border, and when he talked on the topic of landscape later
in life, he used these scenes to encapsulate what he saw as quintessentially English, but what did that mean?

How much has the landscape changed and how recognizable are the same views today?

How can walking with Constable help us understand his work, and what he was doing?
