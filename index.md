John Constable is one of the most celebrated and widely studied artists of the 19th century. Few painters have so vividly evoked a sense of place in their work, one born of intimate familiarity with the countryside he represented and his attentive observation of the smallest detail of the natural world. Constable was born and brought up on the Suffolk-Essex border, and when he talked on the topic of landscape later in life, he used these scenes to encapsulate what he saw as quintessentially English, but what did that mean? How much has the landscape changed and how recognizable are the same views today? How can walking with Constable help us understand his work, and what he was doing? 

This project uses digital technologies to take prints locked in a museum back into the landscape which made them, which represents them, and of which they are part. Using an app enabling us to pinpoint and ‘see’ various Constable sketches we will curate a series of public walks in landscapes Constable sketched, documenting them to produce, as a form of public writing, a walking diary. 

We are interested in what happens when we walk in one landscape but also see another, one produced by Constable, as a sketch, in another century. Amongst our questions are what kind of engagement with the work this produces. Walking with Constable enables a form of slow looking – very different from a typical gallery experience. It might highlight change and development of the landscape – and foreground issues of industrialisation present in Constable’s work. It might change the forms or modes of attention awarded to the sketches – from looking at to walking with, and also suggests re-thinking the relationship of the image to the land. 

We are also interested in exploring how to document a shared experience of viewing and engagement. How does it feel to walk with Constable, what new perceptions, experiences or connections does it produce? How can we capture elements of that experience and bring together expert and general public experiences and produce a form of public writing? Finally how can we mix various kinds of expertise to inform are slow viewing? 

We are also interested in both how much technology is needed to enable the walk (going low) and in how we might supplement the experience – in this case via accompanying ariel photography, via the use of embedded images to over-lay historical and ‘imaginary’ landscapes, and provide new perspectives on time, change, distance and experience. 

Underpinning our inquiry are a series of questions:

How – and in what ways - to use digital technologies to engage with publics in ways that route around standard ‘virtual’ gallery or museum formats. 
How to document these engagements in compelling and accessible ways. 

We see the project both as a standalone project that will produce interesting new forms of engagement with publics around the Constable and as a test site for future projects.
