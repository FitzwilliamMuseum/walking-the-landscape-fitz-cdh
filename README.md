![Repository social card](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/465292641/5f9838da-c16f-4971-b2af-b4ec35f16e0c)

This repository holds the code for a very simple minimum viable product which will provide a vehicle for a collaborative [Fitzwilliam Museum](https://fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk) and [Cambridge Digital Humanities](https://cdh.cam.ac.uk) project.

This project will focus on the landscapes documented by John Constable and his print maker David Lucas, and digital humanities/ phenomenological responses to walking tours within
these depicted locations. The project will hold IIIF images, audio, video, prose and other user contributed content based on walking tours in Suffolk in June/July 2022.
