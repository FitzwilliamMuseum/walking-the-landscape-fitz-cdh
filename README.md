# Walking the landscape

This repository holds the code for a very simple minimum viable product which will
provide a vehicle for a collaborative Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge Digital Humanities
project.

This project will focus on the landscapes documented by John Constable and his print maker
David Lucas, and digital humanities/ phenomenological responses to walking tours within
these depicted locations.
